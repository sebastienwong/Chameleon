### I don't want to read I want to play!
Ok!  You can play it [here](https://chameleonthegame.herokuapp.com/)!  The game is hosted using Heroku.

### About
This is Chameleon, a bluffing deception game based on the board game by Big Potato games, which I recommend checking out [here](https://bigpotato.co.uk/products/the-chameleon)!  This is designed to be played on a monitor, but a mobile version may come out later.

I built this as a web app because I wanted to practice my web-dev skills, as well as learn how to use websockets and React.  This was built with: 
- ***Node/Express*** for the back-end
- ***React*** for the front-end 
- ***Socket.io*** for the websockets.

I wanted to try to build everything from scratch, from-the-ground up. So following plenty of tutorials, I started with setting up the back-end and getting the game working, then moved on to adding the front-end.  This is my first time using React, so it was a bit of a learning curve, but I'm happy with the result (although I definitely have a lot to learn).

### My to-do list for the future
- Big Things
  - ~Add rooms so multiple games can be played at once~
  - Clean up my React! Get the components in their own files. This is proving difficult because I am trying to learn how to use browserify with babel to build the project and its hard :(
  - Add rules section
  - Add more than 1 topic haha
  
- Smaller Things
  - ~Handle disconnections~
  - Make the ui more responsive/feel better
